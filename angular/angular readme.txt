Angular is a JavaScript framework.  It extends HTML attributes with directives and binds data to 
html with expressions.

It extends html with ng-directives.
    ng-app directive to define a angularjs application.
    ng-model directive to bind the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea etc.) to 
        app-data.
    ng-bind directive to bind application to the HTML view.
    ng-init directive initializes angular variables.
    
(these can be data-ng prefixed if you want to pass HTML validation.)

Expressions are written inside {{}} double braces.  Those bind data the same way as ng-bind.

Applications
    Modules define applications.
    Controllers control applications.
    
    ng-app defines the application
    ng-controller defines the controller
